HHA 504- Final Project


## Brief Explanation of App:
- Its a flaskapp that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user-provided height and weight.
- I also included a small conversion calculator on the side, for height and weight, for users that know their measurements based on the imperial metric system and convert them into S.I units required for the calculator to work.
- Lastly the data inputed in the BMI calculator gets stores in a MySQL database.
